Your Chrome user and Google Music user don't seem to match, which is required due to restrictions in Google's apis. To fix this:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    If you sign into Google Music under a different user than Chrome, <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2364824">create a new Chrome profile</a> matching your Google Music user, <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/185277">turn on sync</a>, and then install the extension to that profile instead.
  </li>
  <li>
    If your users already match, check that <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/185277">Chrome syncing</a> is enabled and working, then restart Chrome.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
If you're still seeing this error after trying both approaches, feel free to email me for help: <a href="mailto:simon@simonmweber.com">simon@simonmweber.com</a>
